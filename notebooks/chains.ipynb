It deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. Special relativity introduces the concept of spacetime, where space and time are intertwined, and the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. It also introduces the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy (E) and mass (m).\\n\\nOn the other hand, general relativity is an extension of special relativity that includes gravity. It describes the force of gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. In general relativity, the presence of mass and energy warps the fabric of spacetime, and objects move along curved paths in response to this curvature. General relativity provides a more complete understanding of gravity compared to classical physics, as it explains phenomena such as the bending of light around massive objects and the existence of black holes.\\n\\nIn summary, special relativity deals with objects in uniform motion and introduces the concept of spacetime, while general relativity extends special relativity to include gravity and describes it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.'"
